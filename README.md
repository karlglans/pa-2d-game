This repo shows an example implementation of a top-down 2d game made with React and [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber).

We used the core functionality to create [Colmen's Quest](https://coldigames.itch.io/colmens-quest) 

## Get started and play

You can start the game by `yarn && yarn start`, then [open your Browser](http://localhost:3000/).
